# My Portfolio

My Professional Portfolio

For this weekâ€™s challenge, I challenged myself to create a professional portfolio using what I learned and applied it to my webpage using HTML and CSS from scratch. This is an ongoing webpage that I will be adding over time.

The webpage is in sections that include an about, which contains a brief summary of me, a couple of experiences that I will be learning throughout the Bootcamp, my Linkedin profile, and a way to contact me while keeping in mind of the following requirements:

I have placed a couple of non-placeholder applications that will take the user to the deployed application on my Linkedin and GitHub profile when clicked on.

I have also included some hover effects for various projects on the page.

The webpage was styled for multiple screen sizes, which is suitable for 4k ultrawide displays, laptops, tablets and mobile smartphones.
